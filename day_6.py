#Functions

#Many built-in functions make coding easier
#Functions are a series of instructions used to perform a task repeatedly
#Functions are followed by "()"

print() #print is a function


#"def" is a keyword that creates a function

#def function():
    #do something
    #do something else
    #finally, do this

def my_function():  #The use of "def" is creating a function called "my_function". Everything after the colon is the operation the function will perform
    print("Hello")
    print("Goodbye")
    
my_function()


#While Loops

#While a condition is true, the while loop continues to run
#While loops are better when there is an unknown number times a function must be performed or
#when a condition needs to be met before the function stops running

#while condition_is_true:
    #do something
    #keep doing something

counter = 0
while counter <= 10:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
